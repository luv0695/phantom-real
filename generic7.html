							<h1>Volleyball Conditioning Drills</h1>

							<p>Increase Your conditioning skills with interval training. There are several benefits to interval training that will help you get the majority out of your runs, and increase your stamina.
Improve cardiovascular capacity. Endurance running can take wind out of you. By using the interval training, you'll increase your anaerobic capacity (oxygen-depleting). And when you combine this with aerobic capacity (oxygen-building with easy runs and long runs), these will end up making you faster.
Burning calories. The high-intensity part of interval training will increase the amount of calories you burn.It adds interest to your running routine. 
It may seem a small thing, but state of feeling bored with your normal running routine can make it much harder to stay motivated.</p>

                                                          <p>Easiest way to take in interval training is to alternate equal periods of high and low-intensity running. Start with a ten to fifteen minute warm-up. 
Start with a rapid walk followed by a slow jogging, picking up speed at the end of the warm-up to break into a full run. This will make sure your body is 
properly warmed-up before you begin the intense speed work. If you are first starting out doing intervals, you need to train your body to get used to the 
hard intervals. Run at high speed for one minute followed by two minutes of slow running or walking. Repeat these intervals six to eight times. </p>				
			
     <p>Do this for several weeks until you feel comfortable with the rest. Then lower your recovery/rest time by 30 seconds. Make sure you and your body are ready 
to increase the intensity of the faster pace intervals and reduce your rest/recovery period before you reduce the rest/recovery time.End with a fifteen to 
twenty-five minute cool-down. Ease from a run to a light jogging, and then gradually slow to a walk towards the end of the cool-down period.</p>
