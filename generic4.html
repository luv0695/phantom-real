							<h1>Volleyball Blocking Drills</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Blocking in volleyball is one of the least taught yet most important skills. It is the first line of defense against attacks from the opposing team and 
creates less court for the back defense to cover. By following a few steps you can become a great blocker in volleyball.</p>

                                                          <p>Be ready at all times. Timing is one of the most important aspects in blocking; a fraction of a second could be the difference between stuffing an 
opponentâ€™s attack and missing the ball completely. Being in the ready position will allow you to move more efficiently when try to make a block.
To block the volleyball you should have proper stance.You want to stand light on your feet with little further slightly more than shoulder-width apart,
With your shoulders and hips square to the net you will be able to jump straight up more quickly.knees should be bent so you cn be ready to jumpimmediately 
rather than having to lower yourself and then jump up for the block. Be careful not to get lazy and stand straight up while waiting to block.</p>
 
 <p>Keep your arms high with your elbows around shoulder height. This also reduces the time it takes to get your arms up for the block. If they begin by your 
sides then they have much farther to travel to get high in the air.Keep your palms facing the net. This puts them at the correct angle for blocking and 
again reduces the time needed to get your hands in position, making you a faster blocker.Also allow sufficient space between your body and the net to ensure 
you do not accidentally touch it.</p>
