							<p>Coaching volleyball can be a challenging and valueable experience, especially if you play the sport yourself, or are a passionate follower. There are many 
levels of volleyball to coach, from professional beach or court volleyball to a activity done for enjoyment when one is not working in the community gym. 
Regardless of the level, your volleyball players will need to understand the game, practice their serves and returns and engage in conditioning that 
will keep them quick and flexible on the court. Coach volleyball by effectively communicating with your players, teaching the basics of the game, and leading
your team to successful wins in tournaments and games.</p>
                                                          <p>Communicating effectively With your team. Make sure everyone on your team understands the game. The tactics and logistics are necessary, and you may need to 
teach them if you are coaching beginners.Your players cannot play well if they do not understand the rules of volleyball, and you risk losing points, not to 
mention games. Make sure your team knows what they can and cannot do, what gets them points and what results in penalties.</p>
						<p>Be communicative. Talk to your players supportively, and if you are coaching children, talk to parents openly so they know what is going on at practice.
Keeping your communication positive rather than competitive will demonstrate that you have the best interests of the players in mind and provide a model of
good sportsmanship. This is especially important if you are coaching kids.  Including players in decisions builds trust and encourages them to think 
critically about the game.</p>
            <p>Provide a safe practice environment Whether you are coaching kids or adults, professionals or amateurs, the physical court needs to be safe. Inspect the 
practice and competition courts before every practice and match.When talking to players, use "I" and "we" rather than "you," which puts them on the defensive.
Plan your training sessions in advance. Planning can be time-consuming, but it is important to figure out in advance what to do during practice. </p>
