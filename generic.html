							<h1>Volleyball Drills For Kids</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Volleyball is a fun sport for a distict peroid of history.The early kids start playing, the more ability or training to perform a certain activity or task wel.
they will have.It takes some years to master some volleyball skills.Kids are able to learn most important basics such as passing, serving, and setting.
Other skills, such as spiking, might be too complicated for young learners. The key to working with kids is to keep it source of fun and give lots of motivation.
Teach proper hand placement teach to have them place one hand flat, place their other hand underneath that hand, and curl in their thumbs to the middle of their hands.
Their forearms should form a flat or level surface,which is where the ball will be hit.</p>
							<p>
They can make a fist with their left hand and then cover the fist with their right hand so that their thumbs line up on top.They should never interconnect their fingers
because it is dangerous and they could end with a broken finger.Show the kids a proper stance.They should stand light on their feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart
and their knees bent.</p>
							<p>
The kids can stand in pairs and practice throwing the ball to one another.You can then start moving around and making fun games out of it.One kid can hit the ball 10 times and 
then other can hit the ball 10 times.</p>
